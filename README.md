# Assignment Solutions from [Justin Marsh](https://twitter.com/dogonthecircuit)

**Welcome to Sysadmin and DevOps!**

This repository holds my assignment solutions from the Sysadmin and DevOps 
track at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com).

**Whats in here?**

Each directory contains my code as I progressed through the Holberton program. 
Folders contain assignments on a given topic, each with different specifications. 
These assignments were small-scale, with one day completion times for each folder. 
As such, the code here are samples of my work as time progressed.
